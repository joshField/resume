        \item Developed a smart maintenance sensor network that monitors the treatment \\
        of waste water using an Arduino \& Raspberry  Pi
        \item Created predictive maintenance regression and classification models to predict \\
        the remaining useful life, and most likely root cause of a given failure
        \item Implemented unsupervised anomaly detection models using clustering and autoencoder methods
        \item Coded an Android app to monitor the sensor network with a backend of SQLite \\
